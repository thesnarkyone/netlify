I watched a documentary about urban legends and wondered when we as a society coined the term "killer clown." According to Google NGram it was shortly after the John Wayne Gacy murders came to light in 1978. Although he did not kill or hunt in his final clown form, it seems that the story of Pogo (Gacy as a clown) spread from parents to children in Chicago. This in turn created a mass-hysteria several times in Chicago causing children to claim that clowns were driving around in white vans and kidnapping kids. All of it caused by the spread of a legend, visible in N Gram.
